description: Generate a commit message from git changes
---

Based on files modified or added in git (and in git ONLY), generate a commit message in english for it. Use commit convention (feat, fix, etc.) and precise the scope. Generate it in a temporary text file named "commit_m_tmp.txt". You can structure the message with bullet point, but do not put more unnecessary breaklines to fit into your CLI limitation or default value. No need to ask for my permission to write / modify the text and generate the file. I'll review the result afterward.
